        <h4>Inroduction:</h4>
        <p> Farming and agriculture have always been one of the essential economic activities in India.<br/>
           Near about two-thirds of the population engaged in agriculture and agriculture-related activities,<br/>
           it is crucial to understand India’s plight and why they are struggling. For a few decades, the working<br/>
          environment and the agricultural scenario are stagnant, and it is no more a profit-making sector like before.<br/>
          Our aim is to empower the agricultural sector in India.<br/>
          There is high need that farmers get awared about the new technologies and equiments that can be very benificial<br/>
         for increase of yield.

        <h3>Some General Issues in the Agricultural Sector</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
          Small and fragmented landholdings: One of the primary reasons why Indian farmers are not competent is because of small <br/>andfragmented holdings. Most of the poor farmers have a minimal amount of land and too fragmented. According to data, the average<br/>size of landholding per farmers is decreasing every year. That turns to be the worst. This problem becomes more severe<br/> in highly populated states with less farming land. As per the data, only 1.6% of total land holdings belong to large <br/>holding that too by the wealthy ones. It becomes impossible for a farmer to irrigate and harvest in fragmented lands because<br/> a lot of time gets wasted in moving the resources from one place to another. 
          </li>
          <li>
          The issue in Dealing with local traders or any middleman: It is a significant problem a farmer faces at the end of all <br/>agricultural activity.  Due to the absence of proper mandi houses and appropriate marketplaces, farmers fail to reasonably sell their crops. In this situation, they have to look for a middleman and local traders for business.
          </li>
          <li>
          Seed related issues for farming: The seed is a critical and necessary input for obtaining higher and better crop yields and <br/> sustained agricultural production growth. Distribution of assured quality seed is as essential as the production of such seeds. <br/> Unluckily, good quality seeds are out of reach for most farmers, mostly small and marginal farmers, mainly because of better<br/>  seeds’ exorbitant prices
          </li>
          <li>Manures, Fertilizers, and Biocides: The farmers have used Indian soils for growing crops over thousands of years without <br/> caring much for its replenishing character, which has led to depletion and exhaustion of soils resulting in the low productivity <br/> of crops. The average yield of almost all the produce is the lowest globally and is a severe problem that can be solved <br/> using more manures and fertilizers.</li>
          <li>Lack of proper mechanization: Despite the large scale mechanization of agriculture in some parts of the country, most larger <br/> agricultural sectors are carried on manually by human hand using conventional and straightforward tools and implements like <br/> a wooden plough, sickle, etc.</li>
          <li>Lack of adequate tools and equipment: Even in this era, most Indian farmers use traditional agriculture tools, such as plough,<br/>  sickle, etc. That leads to the wastage of energy and workforce and less yield per capita labor force. Only little use of<br/>  the machine is seen in Irrigation, harvesting, and transportation. There are two reasons why farmers are not using modern <br/> equipment. First, they are not aware, and second, they can’t afford such equipment.</li>
          <li>
          Scarcity of capital: Agriculture is the most crucial industry in India, and like all other industries, it also requires capital.<br/>  The role of capital input is becoming important with every passing day due to farm technology advancement. Since the <br/> agriculturists’ capital is all locked up in his lands, he is obligated to borrow money for stimulating the agricultural produce vfor daily living.
